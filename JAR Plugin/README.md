# ExampleJARPlugin
A plugins main class will always be in the default package.  The name of this class must be the name of the plugin and should be where the onLoad, onEnable, and onDisable methods are.  If your plugin uses the CommandExecutor or EventListener, you can use either the main class or register the events for a different class.
